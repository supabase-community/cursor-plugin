# Supabase Plugin for Cursor

The Supabase plugin for [Cursor](https://cursor.com) gives Cursor the tools and skills needed to work effectively with Supabase projects.

<!-- TODO: Add Cursor install section/command when available -->

## What's Included

- **MCP Server** — Remote connection to the [Supabase MCP server](https://supabase.com/mcp) for project management, SQL execution, migrations, and more
- **Skills** — Agent skills from [supabase/agent-skills](https://github.com/supabase/agent-skills) (e.g. `postgres-best-practices`)

## Development

This repo uses a git submodule for shared agent skills.

After cloning, initialize the submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To update the submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --remote submodules/agent-skills
git add submodules/agent-skills
git commit -m "chore: update agent-skills submodule"
```
